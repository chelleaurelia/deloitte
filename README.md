# Michelle Aurelia's Solution for Deloitte

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Due to my limited capabilities, I am only able to work on the front-end side of the application.

To run the app, create a local repository of the project on your local computer, then open a terminal in the folder of the project and write "npm start". The app will start running in your local host.

Thank you for your time.
